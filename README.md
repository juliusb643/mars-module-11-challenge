Mars Module 11 Challenge 

For the first part of this challenge, I was able to successfully scrape titles and text from Mars News and display it in a consumable way. I used automated browsing and Beautiful Soup to do so, and frequently was checking my notes and consulting with Xpert Learning Assistant. 

For the second part of this challenge, I was able to scrape the data from the HTML Table on the Mars Temperature Data Site and was able to answer the prompted questions. I again used BeautifulSoup to create an object and was able to manipulate the HTML to give me the answers that I needed. 

I exported the second part of this challenge to a CSV file, and have uploaded that as well. 

I could not have done this project without some timely help from ChatGPT, Xpert Learning Assistant through the bootcamp, and my cohort-mate Kiet.
